1) Suppose our input data to a map-reduce operation consists of integer values (the keys are not important). The map function takes an integer i and produces the list of pairs (p,i) such that p is a prime divisor of i. For example, map(12) = [(2,12), (3,12)]. The reduce function is addition. That is, reduce(p, [i1, i2, ...,ik]) is (p,i1 + i2 +...+ ik). Compute the output, if the input is the set of integers 15, 21, 24, 30, 49. **Output**: mapreduce.py
