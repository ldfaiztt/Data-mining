1) A certain Web mail service has 10^8 users and wishes to create a sample of data about these users, occupying 10^10 bytes. Activity at the service can be viewed as a stream of elements, each of which is an email. The element contains the ID of the sender, which must be one of the 10^8 users of the service, and other information, e.g., the recipient(s), and contents of the message. The plan is to pick a subset of the users and collect in the 10^10 bytes records of length 100 bytes about every email sent by the users in the selected set (and nothing about other users).
User ID's will be hashed to a bucket number, from 0 to 999,999. At all times, there will be a threshold t such that the 100-byte records for all the users whose ID's hash to t or less will be retained, and other users' records will not be retained. You may assume that each user generates emails at exactly the same rate as other users. As a function of n, the number of emails in the stream so far, what should the threshold t be in order that the selected records will not exceed the 10^10 bytes available to store records? Identify the value of n and its corresponding value of t. **Output**: email.py
