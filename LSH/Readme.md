1) The edit distance is the minimum number of character insertions and character deletions required to turn one string into another. Compute the edit distance between each pair of the strings he, she, his, and hers. Then, identify the number of pairs at a certain edit distance. **Output**: lcs.py

2) Consider the following matrix:
![minhash.jpeg](https://github.com/shngli/Data-mining/blob/master/LSH/minhash.jpeg)
Perform a minhashing of the data, with the order of rows: R4, R6, R1, R3, R5, R2. Which of the following is the correct minhash value of the stated column? **Output**: minhash.py

3) Consider a matrix representing the signatures of seven columns, C1 through C7:
![candPair.jpeg](https://github.com/shngli/Data-mining/blob/master/LSH/candPair.jpeg)
Suppose we use locality-sensitive hashing with three bands of two rows each. Assume there are enough buckets available that the hash function for each band can be the identity function (i.e., columns hash to the same bucket if and only if they are identical in the band). Find all the candidate pairs. **Output**: candPair.py

4) Find the set of 2-shingles for the "document": ABRACADABRA and also for the "document": BRICABRAC. How many 2-shingles do they have in common? What is the Jaccard similarity between the two documents"? **Output**: shingles.py
